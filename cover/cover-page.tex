% Rules:
% ------
%   width  of cover = width  of text block - 1/8" = 3.2  mm
%   height of cover = height of text block + 1/4" = 6.35 mm
%   space between spine and cover = 1/4"..3/16" + thickness of the bookboard
%   spine width = text block width + 2 * thickness of the bookboard

% Calculations:
% -------------
%   text block width   =  167 mm
%   text block height  =  242 mm
%   board thickness    =  2 mm
%   cover width        =  170 mm
%   cover height       =  248 mm
%   space spine/cover  =  8 mm
%   spine width        =  9.5 + 2 * 2 mm = 13.5 mm

   \def\ExtraH{2.75}    % Extra height

   \def\OffsetF{0.7}    % Text offset on front
   \def\OffsetB{0.7}    % Text offset on back
   \def\BoardT{0.2}     % Bookboard thikness

        There are many flags to turn on/off:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item\texttt{\textbackslash{}Debugtrue} = Show debug frames
        \item\texttt{\textbackslash{}Hardcovertrue} = Show A3 for hardcover
        \item\texttt{\textbackslash{}Plastcovertrue} = Show A3 for plastic wrap
        \item\texttt{\textbackslash{}Softcovertrue} = Show A3 for softcover
        \item\texttt{\textbackslash{}ShowTemplatetrue} = Show the SU template
        \item\texttt{\textbackslash{}TightCliptrue} = Clip to S5 format strictly
        \item\texttt{\textbackslash{}ClipFronttrue} = Show only front cover
        \item\texttt{\textbackslash{}ClipBacktrue} = Show only back cover
        \item\texttt{\textbackslash{}ShowAbstracttrue} = Show abstract
        \end{itemize}
        You can insert your artwork pdf or png instead of crowns. \\[2mm]
        The template uses Verdana, but you can also insert PDFs 
        containing titles in Caecilia fonts
        (see
